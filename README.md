# Insurance-Cost-Prediction
# Project Name :- Insurance Cost Prediction
# Buisness case:- Predicting the cost of insurance considering multiple variables in the data
# Problem Statement
Preparing the data, identifying and extracting key features (both input and output parameters) relevant to the problem we will solve.
Build and train a machine learning model. Here you can evaluate different algorithms, settings and see which model is best for the scenario.
# AIM
 ‚óè Create a machine learning model to predict the insurance price charged to the customer. The charge depends on various features such as age, type of coverage, amount of coverage needed, gender, body mass index 
   (BMI), region, and other special factors like smoking to determine what health risks the person possesses
